# privet_putin
its just a simple project I built for fun, not my limits haha, 
(lol seriously I'm scared one day I will apply for a job and get disqualified when they check my Github as I only post stupid projects here, 
I guess I have to start uploading some of my actual projects to my account and sacrifice those code to open source hahaha)
